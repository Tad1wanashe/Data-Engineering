# Data Modelling with Apache Cassandra

## General

This project deals with a client Sparkify. They have a requirement that will allow them to make certain queries i.e what songs users are listening to. Currently they are not able to fulfill this requirement because all their files are CSVs.
This project is the solution which is an Apache Cassandra database. It is completed using python for the ETL process. I used a Jupyternote book which transfers data from a set of csv files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV files.
